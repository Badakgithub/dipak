3.Bubble Sort Algorithm

# Python3 program for Bubble Sort Algorithm Implementation
def bubbleSort(arr):
n = len(arr)
# For loop to traverse through all
	# element in an array
	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
			# Range of the array is from 0 to n-i-1
			# Swap the elements if the element found
			#is greater than the adjacent element
			if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
				arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
				# Driver code
# Example to test the above code
arr = [ 2, 1, 10, 23 ]
bubbleSort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
	print("%d" % arr[i])
